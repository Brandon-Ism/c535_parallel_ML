# c535_parallel_ML
This repository includes a Jupyter Notebook for spam detection using a sequential approach. The notebook demonstrates how machine learning models can classify text messages as spam or not spam based on provided datasets and evaluates their performance.
**Project Overview**
Spam detection is a classic problem in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. In this project, a sequential (non-parallel) approach is employed to classify messages as spam or non-spam using popular machine learning techniques.
**File Structure**
sequential_spam_detect.ipynb: The primary Jupyter Notebook for this project, where data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation are carried out.
**Setup Instructions**
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/Brandon-Ism/c535_parallel_ML.git
cd c535_parallel_ML/notebooks_b
**Install Required Libraries:** Make sure you have Python installed (3.7+). Then, install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt
**The following libraries are necessary for running this notebook:**

**pandasFor:** data manipulation and analysis
**numpy:** For numerical operations
**scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics
**nltk**: For natural language processing, especially text pre-processing
**matplotlib & seaborn**: For data visualization (optional)
**Dataset:** This notebook assumes access to a labeled dataset of text messages for spam classification, commonly in CSV format with columns such as text and label.

Ensure your dataset file is in the same directory or adjust the file path in the notebook.
